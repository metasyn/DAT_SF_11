# Machine learning

* a part of CS that studies and devs algorithms that can learn from data
* a set of methods that can automatically detect patterns in data and use
    uncovered patterns to predict future data or perform other kinds of
    decision making
* a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being
    explicity programmed

## When do we need it ?

* Some observable patterns exist
* there are no explicitly known equations or dependencies (formulas)
* we have data on it

## Types of Machine Learning

* supervised learning: the goal is to learn mapping from some given inputs x to
    outputs y, given a labeled set of IO pairs (when the training set contains
    explicity examples of what correct output should be for given input)
* unsupervised learning: the coal is to learn interesting patterns and
    structure in data, given only inputs (not output info given)
* reinforcement learning: no explicitly labeled data is given, but 'reward' /
    'punishment' signals are provided 

## What even **is** learning?

* Learning is not about memorizing data and being able to recall it, but its
    generalizing conclusions to previously unseen examples or extracting
    previously unseen patterns
